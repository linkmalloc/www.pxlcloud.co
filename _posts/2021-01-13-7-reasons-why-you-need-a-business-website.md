***Well, I have a business but I don’t really need a website. I have a Facebook page.”***

Anyone who’s been in the digital marketing, social media, or web design business has heard that 👆 reply at least once from an uncertain business owner.

**Tl;dr** Skip this post if you’re not interested in driving more traffic to your website, generating more leads from your target audience, or converting website visitors.

For the rest of you, keep reading because you really need one!

## WHY HAVE A WEBSITE?

As the world plunges into the boiling digital pool, businesses of every size have to keep up and stay relevant. Otherwise, your odds of becoming a dinosaur are remarkably high (and we all know what happened to them).

These days, having a business website means a lot more than just selling your products or promoting your services. According to [statistics on 99firms.com](https://99firms.com/blog/seo-statistics/), in 2017, 97% of people searched online to find a local business near them.

Trustpilot [reports on smallbiztrends.com](https://smallbiztrends.com/2019/04/need-a-website-small-business.html) that over 80% of people trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations.

**Bottom line:** not having a business website today means you’re missing out on a steady stream of web traffic from potential searchers and buyers online. It also means you’re overlooking [today’s most effective weapons](https://atomivox.com/boost-b2b-leads-and-sales-with-content-marketing/) for influencing buyer behavior and driving online sales: reviews, [case studies](https://atomivox.com/case-studies-secret-to-higher-conversions/), and testimonials.

Still unsure why your company needs a web presence? **Here are 7 more top reasons.**

##  

## 7 REASONS WHY YOU NEED A BUSINESS WEBSITE, NOW!

### 1. EVERYONE ELSE IS DOING IT

I know it sounds like a follow-the-leader, Simon-says type of reason. But look at it this way.  Without a business website, there’s absolutely nothing stopping potential customers from searching for *your* products or services but finding your competitor’s fully optimized, mobile-friendly business website instead.

Meaning, they’ll most likely do business with your competitor, not you.

More than ever before, consumers start their [buyer’s journey](https://atomivox.com/how-to-plan-your-marketing-content-buyers-journey/) by Googling and researching online when looking for something.

GoDaddy says, about [70% of U.S. households](https://www.godaddy.com/garage/why-need-small-business-website/) now use the internet when shopping locally for products and services.

If potential buyers can’t find your business on the internet (because you have no company website), customers will take their money elsewhere! So, if you want to keep up with the pack, you need to spruce up your digital flair.

### 2. BUYERS EXPECT YOU TO HAVE A COMPANY WEBSITE!

It’s the 21st century, guys and gals. These days, any modern company under the sun (if you want to compete and win) needs a business website.

According to Clutch, [two-thirds (64%) of small businesses](https://clutch.co/website-builders/resources/small-business-websites-2018) have a website.

That means 6 out of 10 of your competitors *already* have a company website aimed at attracting and converting *your* target audience.

Potential customers expect your company to have a professional, easy-to-navigate business website. If you don’t have one, you’re missing out.

I dare you to keep a straight face while explaining to potential customers that your company doesn’t have a business website. Yet, we hear it all the time!

Access to information is almost too easy and instantaneous. Anybody can pop open a laptop or jump on the phone and search for something.

No one will take your business seriously if you don’t have a website with relevant information.

### 3. TO SHOWCASE WHAT YOUR BUSINESS OFFERS

Having your own branded, professional website allows you to [promote what your business has to offer with confidence](https://atomivox.com/do-these-things-before-spend-new-business-website/). Think of it as offering amazing customer service 24/7.

Better still, your company’s site can sit there convincing customers to do business with *you* and not your competition 24/7/365 without you lifting a finger.

Who needs to rely on traditional sales methods and expensive outbound sales teams when you can have an [inbound marketing strategy](https://atomivox.com/how-to-use-inbound-marketing-to-grow-brands/) working for you just as hard?

[BrightLocal says](https://www.brightlocal.com/research/gender-age-what-consumers-want-from-local-business-websites/) that younger consumers (18-34) *expect* a local business to have a website and are more likely to contact them if they do.

This means you need to do your work to make sure your entire website user experience: branding, design, content, product images and videos truly make an impression.

[![1](https://atomivox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-1200x720_1024x1024.webp)](https://atomivox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/1-1200x720_1024x1024.webp)

Just like you would hire a professional photographer or videographer to capture professional images, you should hire a creative growth marketing agency (like Atomivox®) to design your business website.

Even if your company is a SaaS or digital firm *without a brick-and-mortar location*, you should care what your “storefront” looks like. A business website is no different.

### 4. TO GAIN SOCIAL CREDIBILITY

![pexels photo 1496183](https://atomivox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/pexels-photo-1496183.jpeg)

One thing we’ve learned running a web design agency, having a business website alone [doesn’t *always* fix the problem](https://atomivox.com/6-unlikely-reasons-to-not-redesign-your-companys-website/). Once you’re thinking digitally, a website is just the tip of the iceberg.

There’s [high-converting copy](https://atomivox.com/services/copywriting/), user experience design, landing pages and sales funnels, content offers, [business blogging](https://atomivox.com/free-b2b-blogging-guide/), analytics and tracking. The marketing automation list is endless.

Social credibility is one of the [most important elements](https://atomivox.com/case-studies-secret-to-higher-conversions/) of all. Reliability, or the way customers feel about doing business with you, is key to affecting and steering new prospective customers into choosing you over your competitors. [Shopify states,](https://www.shopify.com/retail/119916611-how-online-reviews-impact-local-seo-and-why-they-matter-to-your-bottom-line)

> *The critical thing to note is that the mental gap between reading a review and making a decision is ridiculously small — and customers typically decide yes or no almost immediately. So, as a small business, your online reputation can directly influence your bottom line.*

Craig Blom’s survey revealed that [84% of shoppers](https://www.inc.com/craig-bloem/84-percent-of-people-trust-online-reviews-as-much-.html) said they trusted online business reviews as much as a personal recommendation from friends or family.

[![5](https://atomivox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-1200x720_1024x1024.webp)](https://atomivox.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5-1200x720_1024x1024.webp)

While you cannot fully control what’s being said about your business on Yelp or other influencer websites, you CAN control the messaging around your own customer’s experiences.

If you have your own business website, that is.

Let your happy clients fly the flag for you. Display their happy remarks, reviews, and glowing praise for all the world to see.

Make sure you always include a logo or customer testimonials section and [case studies](https://atomivox.com/case-studies-secret-to-higher-conversions/) to impress potential website visitors and entice them to engage.

### 5. TO CONTROL WHAT’S BEING SAID

Social media channels are vibrant and packed with information. Information and content that is shared and respawned a zillion times.

Unfortunately, it’s difficult to control what is being said about your own business on social media platforms or review sites. But having a business website gives you the power to control your own narrative.

As we’ve written elsewhere, a [professionally developed brand story](https://atomivox.com/boost-b2b-leads-and-sales-with-content-marketing/) is a powerful tool to increase conversions and influence the public’s perception of your brand. And you don’t even have to work hard at it!

Some estimates claim that over [70 percent of local businesses](https://smallbiztrends.com/2013/08/b2b-small-business-websites-lack-call-to-action.html) are lacking a clear call to action on their website, and 27% don’t even have a phone number on the home page.

You can be better than most of your market competitors just by getting these two things right!

> *”People are drawn to clarity and away from confusion. Having clear calls to action means customers aren’t confused about the actions they need to take to do business with you.”*
>
> *Donald Miller, Building A StoryBrand*

Dialing in on the right voice and tone to express your brand’s personality, (and **offering a compelling call to action**) will have your target audience clamoring to talk to you.

Link all your social media channels to your website and never underestimate the power of [content marketing](https://atomivox.com/how-to-plan-your-marketing-content-buyers-journey/) and blogging to boost your brand online. Share your passion for your business with your audience and stay true to what you stand for.

### 6. TO LET GOOGLE KNOW YOU EXIST

![pexels photo 1036857](https://atomivox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/pexels-photo-1036857.jpeg)

Googling is equivalent to searching. Some older studies revealed that 81% of consumers research online before making a purchase. Fast-forward to as late as 2019, and the number of consumers that went to Google first to find a local business jumped to 97 percent.

This is true for any product or industry, not necessarily only online sales or digital products. Be it a house, a car, a pair of shoes or finding a nice resort to spend your summer vacation, chances are you’re searching on Google before you do anything else.

You can maximize the odds of showing up on Google by [optimizing your website’s SEO](https://atomivox.com/rank-better-keywords-get-more-blog-traffic/), using the right keywords, and the right content strategy to make it happen.

[81 percent](https://blogs.constantcontact.com/small-business-website/) of consumers perform online research before making a purchase. If Google can find you, so can everyone else.

### 7. TO USE THE NEW YORK SYNDROME TO YOUR ADVANTAGE

New York City: the city that never sleeps, right? Well, let’s imagine that your website design and inbound marketing adhered to the same principles.

Wouldn’t it be nice to have a salesperson working for you that never slept, never took a day off, never asked for a raise and didn’t mope about missing sunny vacations?

![times square the city that never sleeps](https://atomivox.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/AzGV.gif)

Unlike a brick-and-mortar business, which can only operate between the hours of 9-5, your website can stay open to potential customers 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, 365 days per year.

It’s true.

Once you optimize your business website with the power of inbound marketing, you could sell non-stop. All it takes is a shift in the way you think about marketing and selling in the 21st century.

Company websites are more than a digital face for your business. They’re online lead generation and sales machines, lead magnets, and strong brand ambassadors — all while you’re sleeping.

In 2018, [75 percent of people](https://www.kinesisinc.com/the-truth-about-web-design/) admitted to making judgments on a business’ credibility based on their company website design. Online shoppers are judging yours, whether you have one. Or don’t.

Life in a digital world has made people accustomed to the convenience of getting whatever they want or need with just a few clicks of a button. Customers now expect their favorite restaurant to offer online ordering. Has your business implemented an online ordering system? If not, then it’s time to learn about the benefits of online ordering.

## Benefits of online ordering for restaurants

1. An improved customer experience
2. Streamlined restaurant operations

## Benefits of online ordering

Offering online ordering on your website or app brings several benefits for both restaurants and customers:

### 1. An improved customer experience

When the ordering process is easy, it increases the likelihood that the customer will complete their order. People want fast, immediate service — which is why the user experience is critical when someone is ready to make a purchase. Customers appreciate not having to sit in their car or the restaurant to wait for their food.

### 2. Streamlined restaurant operations

Online ordering can streamline your systems in the kitchen. When customers send their orders online, it decreases the amount of time staff members need to spend on the phone. Instead, the team can complete the steps — such as cooking the food, packaging it, and delivering it — necessary to ensure that every meal is ready for your customers on time.

### 3. More time to browse the menu

Customers want to know specifics about their food options, which is why it’s smart to list details and descriptions in the online ordering system. Not only does an online menu provide more information about food options, but it allows customers to take the time they need to browse the menu.

### 4. Increased transaction amounts

Since customers have more time to browse the menu online, there’s a greater chance that they’ll add extra items to their order. An additional appetizer or dessert might seem insignificant, but the numbers can add up over time.

### 5. More customer control over orders

When you’re busy during the dinner rush, it’s easy for small order details to slip through the cracks. Your staff doesn’t have a lot of time to spend on phone calls, often resulting in rushed conversations and missed information. One of the benefits of online ordering for restaurants is that customers manage their own orders, which gives them the ability to order exactly what they want — and that includes giving special instructions.

### 6. Easier to place large orders

The likelihood of miscommunication increases when a customer places a large order over the phone. When someone needs a large or complex food order, they will go with the easiest option. Often, people want to avoid ordering over the phone because sharing the full order verbally can be tedious. Online ordering is a simple solution for large orders, helping to decrease the possibility of miscommunication and increase customer satisfaction.

### 7. Being on top of current trends

If you want to stay relevant in the industry, then you need to keep up with the trends. What does it say about your restaurant when you don’t have a website and your competitors are offering online [food ordering](https://www.jotform.com/food-ordering-system/)? You need to stay competitive, which means that you need to be up to date with an online presence and the option for digital orders.

### 8. Fewer abandoned orders

How often do customers place phone orders and never pick up the food? When you have an online ordering system, your restaurant benefits from [online payments](https://www.jotform.com/online-payments/). Customers pay for their food digitally when submitting their order, which reduces the chances of fake or abandoned orders. As a result, you reduce your risk and ensure that you receive payment.

## Integrate online ordering on your website

Having a website is the first step to offering customers a digital experience. Next, you need to integrate digital forms on the site to enable online ordering. If you provide a streamlined ordering system, your customers are more likely to order from you again in the future.

So.

The important question.

What percentage of internet traffic is mobile?

#### **2.** **Up to 70 percent of web traffic comes from mobile devices.**

*(Source: Blue Corona)*

Mobile phones are convenient to carry about while providing easy and quick access to needed information. Probably that’s why there are more than [3.5 billion smartphone users](https://techjury.net/stats-about/smartphone-usage/) worldwide.

Developing European nations and continents like Africa caught up with other parts of the world in terms of information and technological advancements with the aid of affordable mobile devices. This explains why **the mobile industry is the most significant contributor to web traffic today.**

#### **3.** **80% of Alexa’s top-ranked websites are mobile-friendly.**

*(Source: Impact BND)*

Customers on mobile are not as patient as customers on other devices. **They expect websites to load as fast as possible.** They also want **websites to be easily navigable** and to **provide whatever information is needed in no time.**

For **every second of delay**, **you lose a percentage of your site visitors.** Plus, Google, which controls more than 90% of search traffic on the internet, prioritizes mobile-friendly sites.

Given what percentage of internet traffic is mobile, it’s simply vital to have a mobile-optimized website.

#### **4.** **According to mobile internet statistics, 61% of mobile users will never return to a website if it is not mobile adaptive.**

#### **5.** **80% of mobile users claim they are most likely to buy from companies with easy to navigate mobile sites and apps.**

*(Source: Aumcore)*

*(Source: Think With Google)*
